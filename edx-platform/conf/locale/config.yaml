# How should .po files be segmented?  See i18n/segment.py for details. Strings
# that are only found in a particular segment are segregated into that .po file
# so that translators can focus on separate parts of the product.
#
# We segregate Studio so we can provide new languages for LMS without having to
# also translate the Studio strings. LMS needs the strings from lms/* and
# common/*, so those will stay in the main .po file.
